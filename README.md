DWS DC 2019 NiFi Crash Course WMATA Bus Data Demo

This repo can be checked out and hosted by a simple web server. I used Apache2 HTTPD.


The data used for this demo was obtained from [the WMATA website](https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/54763629281d83086473f231/operations/5476362a281d830c946a3d68).

The majority of this demo was derived from [the Leaflet Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) and the [Leaflet Realtime Module](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime).
